                        <div class = "text">
                            <h6>Collaborative learning includes peer learning, academic interactions with seniors, and
                                out-of-the-classroom discussions with professors. It is an integral part of the IIT
                                education system and plays a significant role in developing one’s academic calibre.
                                Moreover, it also helps in building better relationships among the community.
                                However, the lack of collaborative learning in the online mode in comparison with the
                                offline mode has affected academic interactions, thereby hampering the learning
                                process.
                                <br>
                                How can student leaders ensure that collaborative learning is extended to an online
                                semester? What steps can the student leaders take to make online collaborative
                                learning more effective and fruitful?
                            </h6>
                            <br>
                            Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, our education system has been compelled to
                            function virtually. The student leaders agreed that collaborative learning is severely
                            lacking in the online mode. They also realised the need for bringing about innovative
                            ideas in the online teaching environment. The discussion, therefore, focused on
                            attempting to address some of the most common issues such as lack of interaction,
                            increased screen time, and helping freshers adjust to their college life.
                            <br>
                            These are the main points that were put forward in the discussions -
                            <br>
                            • Students can introduce domain-specific student mentorship. Individual mentors
                            can be allotted within different domains in academics, cultural, sports, etc.
                            <br>
                            • Student leaders agreed that there is a need for an effective way to manage all the
                            mentorship initiatives wherein students can appoint a convener who will oversee
                            the execution of the same.
                            <br>
                            • Student leaders suggested conducting online academic activities such as tutorials,
                            course projects, etc. in groups. This will encourage the students to connect with
                            each other and have productive discussions.                            
                            <br>
                            • Student leaders suggested the need for an informal interactive session at the end
                            of every lecture. This interactive session will facilitate students to have relevant
                            discussions with faculties and promote online collaborative learning.
                            <br>
                            • Students can form reading groups spanning a variety of genres like art, literature,
                            science, and technology for freshers. This will increase peer-to-peer interaction
                            and acquaint them with a variety of domains.

                        <div class = "text">
                            <h6>Innovation involves critical thinking, interpreting and implementing creative ideas. It
                                can range from enhancing the value of an existing solution to creating a novel
                                technology. An innovative mindset supplements a student’s overall growth and is
                                highly valued in a workplace. Inclination towards scoring high grades may sideline
                                exploring unconventional paths. Innovation is often hard to teach in a traditional
                                classroom setting because it is unpredictable, requires learning by doing, and stems
                                from practice.
                                <br>
                                What steps can student leaders take to foster conceptual learning? How can student
                                leaders promote critical and creative thinking, and encourage the habit of coming up
                                with out of the box solutions among students? How can student leaders create a
                                culture of innovation among students?
                            </h6>
                            <br>
                            The student leaders acknowledged the need to inculcate an innovative mindset among
                            the students. The discussions were focused on promoting innovation both on an Intracollege and Inter-IIT level.
                            <br>

                            <h6>Hands-on learning helps students appreciate the utility of the concepts taught in the class. Moreover, it
                                enhances the students’ ability to apply their theoretical knowledge to real-world problems. The courses, at
                                present, have elements like labs and projects to provide the students with an opportunity for hands-on
                                learning. However, it has been observed that sometimes the students do not completely realize the
                                importance of these opportunities.
                                What can student leaders do to make students appreciate the already existing elements for hands-on
                                learning? What other initiatives can student leaders take to promote hands-on learning in courses? What
                                can student leaders do to help create an environment so that students involve themselves in hands-on

                            </h6>
                            • In the experience of the student leaders, the major impediments associated with making hands-onlearning a part and parcel of the overall academic journey of the students are:
                            <br>
                            • Availability of limited projects with an active hands-on learning component for the students.
                            <br>
                            • Lack of perseverance among students while working leads to incomplete projects.
                            Some of the ideas proposed addressing these issues were -
                            <br>
                            • A platform may be developed for interested students to collaborate and come up with student-run
                            projects related to the core courses.
                            <br>
                            • Student leaders may help collaborate with the industry to get course-related practical projects.
                            <br>
                            • Student leaders may come up with projects that use equipment/facilities in labs within the institute.
                            <br>
                            • Incentives may be provided at the end of the semester on the successful completion of academic
                            projects.

                                not directly linked to one's department/discipline. These courses are instrumental for the students in a
                                variety of ways. They are crucial in improving their skills, exploring different subjects and bridging the gap
                                between various fields. However, we have observed that some students fail to recognize the objective
                                behind the inclusion of such courses in the curriculum and therefore portray a lack of interest in the same.
                                What initiatives can the student leaders take to promote the importance of these courses
                                among students?                                
                            </h6>
                            • Student leaders agreed on the importance of including a variety of courses. The discussions proceeded
                            with the consensus that an undergraduate degree is more about exploring various subjects rather than
                            specialization.
                            <br>
                            • The main points that were put forward in the discussions were -
                            <br>
                            • Student leaders stated the issue of lack of awareness among students about the course content,
                            outcome and its importance. This lack of awareness is the reason behind students taking up courses
                            with lenient grading policy instead of choosing courses wisely.
                            <br>
                            • Student leaders suggested creating a portal that contains the details of the course contents and its
                            relevance. This portal would better serve its purpose if seniors explain real-life applications of the
                            courses.
                            <br>
                            • There is a need to create awareness about the compulsory courses, which are not domain-specific,
                            among freshmen and sophomores. For this, avenues can be created in the induction program or
                            during the initial weeks of the first year.
                            <br>
                            • To promote the relevance of these courses, faculty, alumni, and seniors can help in chalking out a
                            discipline/department wise roadmap.
                            <br>
                            • The importance of courses can be conveyed to students by citing examples of alumni who are
                            working in fields relevant to such courses.
                            <br>
                            • Students will appreciate the course if there are interdisciplinary projects through collaboration with
                            tinkering facilities.
                            <br>
                            • Various clubs can organise sessions to make students realise the importance of specific courses (E.g. -
                            Sessions on Economics by Finance club).

                                By volunteering in community service initiatives, students shoulder responsibility on a larger scale and they
                                become socially aware. They are exposed to new challenges, gain necessary experience and this indeed,
                                moulds them into better individuals.

                                How can more members from the student community be encouraged to volunteer in these activities? In
                                what way can we merge social responsibility into being a part of the mainstream college life?

                            • Every club, be it technical or cultural, can engage in community service.
                            <br>
                            • IITs can adopt nearby villages to come up with solutions to various problems faced by them.
                            Student participation can be ensured by providing various incentives.
                            <br>
                            • Every IIT can take up one domain of social problem (sanitation, cleanliness drives, etc.) as a theme
                            for a semester. Students can collaborate with faculties to work on this problem throughout the
                            semester. Incentives can be provided to students with effective and implementable
                            solutions.Students can associate themselves with the schools in nearby villages and promote
                            “learning by doing”. This can be achieved by conducting fun activities or getting students involved
                            in DIY projects.
                            <br>
                            • Student leaders can conduct surveys in the nearby villages to know the problems faced by them
                            which can be floated as student-driven projects, overnight hackathons, etc.
                            <br>
                            • Completion of a minimum number of social hours can be made an eligibility criteria for students
